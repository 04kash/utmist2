# Description

Last year at UTMIST, the Virtual Creatures Project successfully managed to evolve and train an impressively diverse range of walking and swimming creatures, all just using a simple evolutionary algorithm from 1994. This year, we will take this project to the next level by introducing **intelligent teamwork and collaboration** between these evolved creatures, using **NEAT** and modern **multi-agent reinforcement learning** techniques.

Developers best suited for this project should have a strong interest in evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning, have experience with Unity and C#, and be committed to 3-6 hours per week. Email anoop.reh@gmail.com or efetoronto@gmail.com (or DM “Anoop R.” or “Efe T.” in the UTMIST Discord) if you’re interested!

# Developer Requirements

Our team is divided into the following three subteams, each of which have their own respective requirements:

The **Evolution Subteam** is mainly responsible for evolving creatures using ml-agents and NEAT. We are looking for **4 developers** that ideally have prior experience with or a strong understanding of:
- Modern multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms
- Evolutionary algorithms, and especially the NEAT algorithm
- Implementing and performing operations on complex graph structures
- Working on large codebases in C#

The **Environment Subteam** is mainly responsible for developing the soccer environment in Unity and interfacing it with the creatures. We are looking for **2 developers** that ideally have prior experience with or a strong understanding of:
- Developing 3D physics-based games with Unity and C#
- Implementing and performing operations on complex graph structures

The **Visualization Subteam** is mainly responsible for developing informative visualizations of both the training process as well as the physical representations of the creatures themselves. We are looking for **2 developers** that ideally have prior experience with or a strong understanding of:
- Insightful data analysis and visualization
- 3D graphics development in Unity (working with shaders, lighting, VFX, etc.)
- UI design and implementation in Unity
- Creating simple 2D and 3D assets (models and textures)
